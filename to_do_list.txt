There is a problem with substitute_into_ and preaddressing. You might want this in order to apply the same function to both sides.
class FunctionSubstituteTest(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        F = f(x)
        A = y & x**2-5
        T = A >> ( substitute_into_(F, preaddress='0') | substitute_into_(F, preaddress='1') )
        T.propagate()
        self.add(T.mob)
        #self.embed()


Provide a way to concatenate Timelines, in particular which can handle them each having their own rules for next_action
