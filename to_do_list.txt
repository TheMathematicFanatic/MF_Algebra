Refactor get_glyphs_indices_at_address into several methods
- get_glyphs_at_address
- get_left_paren_glyphs
- get_right_paren_glyphs
- get_op_glyphs
- get_exp_glyphs_without_parentheses

Then make get_glyphs which can accept a pseudoaddress: an address which
may contain some special characters ( ) * _ which will trigger one or more
of the above methods.

This is sensible because it will allow these pseudoaddresses to be used in
the addressmap of SmartActions, making it easy to tell actions what to do
with parentheses and such, when you want.





Refactor SmartRational to be only a subclass of SmartDivision and not SmartNumber.

This is sensible because 5/3 is no more a number than 5^3 or 5+3, and this way
it can share all code with SmartDivision and still get its own methods like reduce.
